# LetterCapitalization
Manipulate the case of letters
2)  Write a program with three functions:  upper, lower, and reverse.

The upper function will accept a pointer to a string or C-string as an argument.  It will step through each character in the string converting it (where necessary) to uppercase.

The lower function will accept a pointer to a string or C-string as an argument.  It will step through each character in the string converting it (where necessary) to lowercase.

Like the upper and lower functions, the reverse function will accept a pointer to a string or C-string.  It will step through each character in the string converting uppercase characters to lowercase and lowercase characters to uppercase; numbers and special characters will be unaffected.

The program will execute the functions in the following order:  upper, lower, and reverse.

When entering "AbCd", the upper function will return "ABCD"; the lower function will return "abcd"; and the reverse function will return "aBcD".
